# Business Site

The purpose this week was to create a business site containing a hero video, a signup form and an accordion.
I chose to keep last week's dog theme, building an application page for a day care center for dogs.

## The problem

Describe how you approached to problem, and what tools and techniques you used to solve it. How did you plan? What technologies did you use? If you had more time, what would be next?

## View it live
Every project should be deployed somewhere. Be sure to include the link to the deployed project so that the viewer can click around and see what it's all about.
